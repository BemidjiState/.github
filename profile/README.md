# Helpful tips

Here is some helpful information on using GitHub within an organization. Some of this also applies to using git in general. The official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com) are a good resource on how to use GitHub features.

## Best practices

* Never commit private information, passwords, API keys, or Personal Access Tokens (PATs) in a git repository (repo).
* Commits should be small and frequent.
* Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification for human and machine readable commit message.

## Collaborators and teams

Working within an organization offers some additional features compared to a personal GitHub account. In our organization, repos are set to private by default, with the option to make them public. You can selectively grant access to a private repo for individuals or entire teams. Here's how to provide access to a private repo.

1. From the repo page, go to the **Settings** page.
1. On the sidebar, select **Collaborators and teams**.
1. Use the **Add people** or **Add teams** button.
1. Select the person or team you would like to grant access to.
1. When prompted, select a role for the person or team and use the **Add selection** button to submit your choice.
