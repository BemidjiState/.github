# The .github repo

This is a special repo for using GitHub features within this organization. For example, see [GitHub docs on customizing your org profile](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile).

## Reusable workflows for GitHub actions

Reusable workflows can be stored in `BemidjiState/.github/.github/workflows` as long as they are very simple. Reusable workflows that are more complex should exist within their own repo.
